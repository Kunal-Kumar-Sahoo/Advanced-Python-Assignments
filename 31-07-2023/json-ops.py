# Read and write JSON data to/from a file. The code defines two functions, read_json(filename) and write_json(filename, data), 
# that handle reading and writing JSON data from/to a file, respectively. It provides an example usage where it creates a 
# sample JSON object, writes it to a file, reads it back from the file, modifies the JSON data, and then writes the updated 
# data back to the file.
